# [RFC 1] Initial App Architecture
Status: Draft

This RFC covers detail of how the app should be implemented with minimal fashion. It includes the architecture of the app implementaâ€ ion should follow, the minimal API details which RFC 0 is mentioned, and tech stack choices (programming language and database engine).

## Architecture implementation
The implementation should follow 3 layer architecture: handler, service, and persistence. The scopes of each layer are follow:
- **handler**: contribute to validate / modify the request and response, give appropriate http code status (IETF RFC7231), define contract definition for request and response, and become a model adapter between outside world contract and service layer contract.
- **service**: contains business related logic and model adapter between service layer contract and persistence layer contract. Service is not necessarily the name of the resource, it can be any object.
- **persistence**: handling the data management to interact with persistence object. Including storing, accessing, deleting, and updating. The name in persistence layer should be a resource name, and the behaviour is limited on CRUD.

Another layer but important:
- **sdk**: contains any components which essential for another developer to develop their own client/addon to interact with secondbrain app.
