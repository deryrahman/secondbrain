# [RFC 1] Initial App Architecture
Status: Draft

This RFC covers detail of how the app should be implemented in minimal fashion. It includes the architecture of the app implementaâ€ ion should follow, the minimal API details which RFC 0 is mentioned, and tech stack choices (programming language and database engine).

## Architecture implementation
The implementation should follow 3 layer architecture: handler, service, and persistence. The scopes of each layer are follow:
- **handler**: contribute to validate / modify the request and response, give appropriate http code status (IETF RFC7231), define contract definition for request and response, and become a model adapter between outside world contract and service layer contract.
- **service**: contains business related logic and model adapter between service layer contract and persistence layer contract. Service is not necessarily the name of the resource, it can be any object.
- **persistence**: handling the data management to interact with persistence object. Including storing, accessing, deleting, and updating. The name in persistence layer should be a resource name, and the behaviour is limited on CRUD.

Another layer but important:
- **sdk**: contains any components which essential for another developer to develop their own client/addon to interact with secondbrain app.

## Initial API details
Before jump in into the endpoint details, it's worth to mention that secondbrain app uses api with semantic versioning scheme. These following rules are applied:
- the endpoint convention should be like this /api/v1.0.0/<resource_name>
- endpoint /api/<resource_name> should be pointing out to latest api version
- endpoint with only mention major version, eg /api/v1/<resource_name> should be pointing out to latest version which major version resides
- resource name should be prural

### Create note with tags

**Endpoint**: POST /api/v0.1.0/notes
**Request Body**:
```json
{
    "content": <string>,
    "tags": [<string>,]
}
```
**Response**:
```json
{
    "id": <string>
}
```

**Response Status Codes**:
- 201: notes are created successfully
- 5xx: indicates something wrong in server

### Get list of notes

**Endpoint**: GET /api/v0.1.0/notes
**Request Params**:
- tag: specify the tag to fetch the list of note which match with this tag
**Response**:
```json
{
    "note_snippets": [
        {
            "id": <string>,
            "excerpt": <string>,
            "tags": [<string>,]
        },
    ]
}
```

**Response Status Codes**:
- 200: list of notes are fetched successfully
- 404: indicates the notes are not exist
- 5xx: indicates something wrong in server

## Tech Stack Choices

Shortlisted the tech stack uses:
- Go
- PostgreSQL
